[1]"exam_GD" is an example of gradient descent optimization, with the matlab implementation.
It finds the minimum of a given function. Directly copy the code into a matlab .m file and
it should work well in its present form. 

[2] "exam_Newton" is an example of Newton method, with the matlab implementation.
It finds the minimum of a given function. Directly copy the code into a matlab .m file and
it should work well in its present form. 

[3]"exam_LM" is an example of Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm, with the matlab implementation.
It approximates a given function with noisy data. Directly copy the code into a matlab .m file and
it should work well in its present form. 

[4]"exam_GA" is an example of Genetic Algorithm, with the matlab implementation.
It approximates a given function by fitting. Directly copy the code into a matlab .m file and
it should work well in its present form. 

[5]"exam_PSO" is an example of Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, with the matlab implementation.
It finds the minimum value of a given function. Directly copy the code into a matlab .m file and
it should work well in its present form. 

[6]"exam_gpr" is an example of Gaussian process regression, with the matlab implementatin. 
It predicts the mean and 95% trust region (2sigma) of a noisy sin(x) with the GPR algorithm.   

[7]"exam_bayesopt" is an example of bayesian optimization, with the matlab builtin function. 
It finds the minimum of a fiven function. Directly copy the code into a matlab .m file and it 
should work well in its present form. 

[8]"exam_PSO_const" is an example of Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, with the matlab implementation. 
It finds the minimum value of a given function with the constraints. 
Directly copy the code into a matlab .m file and it should work well in its present form.
